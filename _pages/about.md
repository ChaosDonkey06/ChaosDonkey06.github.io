I'm working on statistical tools to inform interventions and study dynamics at population-level of SARS-CoV2. My approaches rely mostly in stochastic, mechanistics models that integrate carefully uncertainty in model structure (underlying biology of the disease, uncertainty in measuring and "predicting" human behaviors), parameters estimates both from uninformed prior knowledge of the disease or rather carefully reviwed from literature. I'm also interested in real time modelling and therefore I usually try to model the surveillance system uncertainties (i.e., reporting, both delays and capacity). Models currently focus on the city-level dynamics.

I'm also interested in using Machine Learning and statistical methods in a data-science fashion to understan correlation between mobility, socio-economic variables and covid19 incidence (all dificult variables to measure!). 

My free time is mostly spend running and riding my bike.

Summary
======
- I'm a research assistant in the [Faculty of Medicine](https://medicina.uniandes.edu.co/) at [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/) in Bogotá D.C. in Colombia working with Dr. Juan M. Cordovez and Dr. [Mauricio Santos-Vega](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RmrmFqoAAAAJ&hl=en) both with the Grupo de Biología y Matemática Computacional [BIOMAC](https://ingbiomedica.uniandes.edu.co/es/investigacion/lineas-investigacion/biologia-matematica-computacional). Specifically we use stochastic mechanistic models and inference methods to understand dynamics and therefore forecast based on assumptions. Currently we are working in disentangle transmission across spatial scale and across ages as tranmission is hugely heterogeneus across space-demography.

- I'm also part of the awesome [DataLama](https://datalama.polyglot.site/#/) team under the mentoring of [Alejandro Feged](https://alejandrofeged.github.io/) and [Vladimir Corredor](https://scholar.google.com.co/citations?user=MQrRC8sAAAAJ&hl=en), our field of research is public health and we aim to use novel statistical methods to measure the real-time impact of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and contribute to a better design of public health policies. During the 2020 covid19 crisis we develop automated pipelines for creating [weekly reports](https://datalama.polyglot.site/#/HistoricoReportes) about mobility using Facebook Mobility Data and epidemiology using cases times series data available from the National Health Institute [INS](https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/paginas/coronavirus.aspx).
