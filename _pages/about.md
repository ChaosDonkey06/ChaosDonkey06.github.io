I'm working on statistical tools to inform interventions and study dynamics at population-level of SARS-CoV2. My approaches rely mostly in stochastic, mechanistics models that integrate carefully uncertainty in model structure (underlying biology of the disease, uncertainty in measuring and "predicting" human behaviors), parameters estimates both from uninformed assumptions hence estimated or from carefull literature review. I'm also interested in real time modelling and therefore I usually try to model the surveillance system uncertainties (i.e., reporting delays and limitations). Models currently focus on the city-level dynamics.

Summary
======
I'm a research assistant in the [Faculty of Medicine](https://medicina.uniandes.edu.co/) at [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/) in Bogot√° D.C. in Colombia. I mostly focus on study population level dynamics of SARS-CoV2 at city level in Colombia.


My free time is mostyl spend running or reading about nature-biology curiosities, currently I'm reading (Unsolved Problems in Ecology)[https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691199825/unsolved-problems-in-ecology] (not a textbook! haha).

I'm always interested in leveraging new research and scientific skills so if you would like to rant about some modelling/infectious-disease problems no doubt to get in touch :)!
