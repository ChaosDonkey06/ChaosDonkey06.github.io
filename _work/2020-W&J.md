Machine Learning engineer with [Whale and Jaguar](https://whaleandjaguar.co) a great start-up based in Bogotá. Their goal is to understand people behavior using social media data (posts, images, mention network, etc). I work in a variety of natural language processing project including two user oriented chatbot with a voice recognition spanish and english system using [deepspeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595) backbone. I also work with automated generation of reggaeton lyrics and christmas carols using [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2?text=A+long+time+ago%2C+) (click for a Hugging Face demo). Finally I worked on using DETR detection and segmentation model to start relating object content features (color, frequency of appearence, etc) with engagement social media scores.
