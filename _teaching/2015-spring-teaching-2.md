I had the opportunity to TA the course Modelado y Simulacón de Sistemas Biomédicos for 2 years in a round 2018-20, 2019-10, 2019-20 and 2020-10. Each version of the course was teached by a different combination of Prof. Carlos Bravo-Vega, Prof. Jose Arteaga and Prof. Mauricio Santos. As each professor has their own touch of the course and their contents for me it was super interesting seeing how we as a team evolved from a theoretical epidemiology class into a more computing and simulation infectious disease class.

During this time I kind of fall in love with modelling as a tool for science research which is only a logical and organized mathematical way to put your ideas into. I realize that while teaching you create a lot of materials that results mostly the pc bin (lol) so I decided to go trough all those classes and labs and create a [Gihub Repo](https://github.com/ChaosDonkey06/ID_Modeling) both for future TAs or for any curious human in this recently growing topic. I do not exactly divide the repository in the same content as the syllabus but more how I feel it work.
