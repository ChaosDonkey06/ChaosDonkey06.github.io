I had the opportunity to TA the course Modelado y Simulacón de Sistemas Biomédicos for 2 years in a round 2018-20, 2019-10, 2019-20 and 2020-10. Each version of the course was teached by a different combination of Prof. Carlos Bravo, Prof. Jose Arteaga and Prof. Mauricio Santos. As each professor has their own touch of the course and their contents it was a lot of fun to teach the class and also it was super interesting seeing how we as a team evolved from a theoretical epidemiology class into a more computing and simulation infectious disease class. (Click the title for more info.)

During this time I kind of fall in love with modelling as a tool for science research which is only a logical and organized mathematical way to put your ideas into. I realize that while teaching you create a lot of materials that results mostly the pc bin (lol) so I decided to go trough all those classes and labs and create a [Gihub Repo](https://github.com/ChaosDonkey06/ID_Modeling) both for future TAs or for any curious human in this recently growing topic. I do not exactly divide the repository in the same content as the syllabus but more how I feel it work. Below I list some of the reference we use on the class and some others that I personally enjoy for having different perspectives about modelling and their analysis and some other more technical about specific parts of the course.

Note

I'm still working on the repo on my free times so please if you find any bug or would like to contribute just go for it and make your pull request or get in touch!
